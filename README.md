# Elementary Postinstall Script

Hello, this little script created for **elementaryOS** will save you time when reinstalling your machine(s).
The goal is to group the most used software so that you can install them all with a simple click.

I will try to update this script according to the updates of the repositories / **elementaryOS**


```
wget -O /tmp/elementary-postinstall-script.sh https://raw.githubusercontent.com/amaury-cleuziou/elementaryos-postinstall-script/master/elementary_post-install.sh && chmod +x /tmp/elementary_post-install.sh && elementary_post-install.sh
```
